WHAT'S NEW
==========

In tkpath 0.3.3 (October 2014):
-------------------------------

Bug fixes:

    - updated for recent OS X versions (the code did not compile or work
      due to the use of deprecated APIs)

    - pimage: -width/-height did not work on all platforms

    - pimage: faulty rendering of images with partial transparency on Linux
      (Cairo requires R,G,B channels to be pre-multiplied by the alpha channel)

    - pline, polyline, path: -strokedasharray behavior was inconsistent across
      platforms (on Linux, dash lengths were not scaled by the line width)

    - transparency was not implemented for gradient fills

    - transform skewx/skewy was bogus (needed tan() instead of sin())

    - "delete all" was unusable as it always complained about not being able
      to delete the root item

New item options:

    - pimage: anchoring (-anchor); image interpolation mode (-interpolation);
      cropping and tiling (-srcregion); tinting (-tintcolor, -tintamount)

    - ptext: anchoring options extended (-textanchor); support for bold
      (-fontweight) and italic (-fontslant); contoured text (-filloverstroke)

    - pline, polyline, path: arrowhead support (-startarrow, -startarrowlength,
      -startarrowwidth, -startarrowfill; same for end arrow)

Other:

    - matrix multiplication utility function (tkp::transform mult)
